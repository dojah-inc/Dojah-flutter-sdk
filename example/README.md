## Usage

To start KYC, import Dojah in your React Native code, and launch Dojah Screen

```dart
import 'package:dojah_kyc_sdk_flutter/dojah_kyc_sdk_flutter.dart';

DojahKyc.launch(
  "{Required: Your_WidgetID}",
  referenceId: "{Optional: Reference_ID}",
  email: "{Optional: Email_Address}”
)

```

### SDK Parameters
- `WidgetID` - a `REQUIRED` parameter. You get this ID when you sign up on the Dojah platform, follow the next step to generate your WidgetId.
- `Reference ID` - an `OPTIONAL` parameter that allows you to initialize the SDK for an ongoing verification.
- `Email Address` - an `OPTIONAL` parameter that allows you to initialize the SDK for an ongoing verification.

## How to Get a Widget ID
To use the SDK, you need a WidgetID, which is a required parameter for initializing the SDK. You can obtain this by creating a flow on the Dojah platform. Follow these steps to configure and get your Widget ID:

```txt
1. Log in to your Dojah Dashboard: If you don’t have an account, sign up on the Dojah platform.

2. Navigate to the EasyOnboard Feature: Once logged in, find the EasyOnboard section on your dashboard.

3. Create a Flow:

    - Click on the 'Create a Flow' button.
    - Name Your Flow: Choose a meaningful name for your flow, which will help you identify it later.

4. Add an Application:

    - Either create a new application or add an existing one.
    - Customise your widget with your brand logo and color by selecting an application.

5. Configure the Flow:

    - Select a Country: Choose the country or countries relevant to your verification process.
    - Select a Preview Process: Decide between automatic or manual verification.
    - Notification Type: Choose how you’d like to receive notifications for updates (email, SMS, etc.).
    - Add Verification Pages: Customize the verification steps in your flow (e.g., ID verification, address verification, etc.).
    
6. Publish Your Widget: After configuring your flow, publish the widget. Once published, your flow is live.

7. Copy Your Widget ID: After publishing, the platform will generate a Widget ID. Copy this Widget ID as you will need it to initialize the SDK as stated above.
```
